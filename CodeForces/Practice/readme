Codes to all problems I've solved on CodeForces outside of contests.

Problems are marked (IMP) if they
  - introduced a new concept
  - have multiple very different solutions
  - have much more efficient solutions than the one I used, and so need to be revisited
  - have a description (those 3 dots above the code/file showing commit changes)
